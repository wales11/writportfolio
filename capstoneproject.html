									<h2>Senior Capstone Project</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/moneyball.jpg" alt="Moneyball" /></a>
								<p>My senior capstone project tackles the issue of providing education for the average baseball fan on the topic of advanced statistics, often called sabermetrics. For my senior capstone project, I conducted both primary research and secondary research. My primary research was done in the form of interviews with casual baseball fans and industry professionals working in MLB front offices. I received varied feedback between the two groups, and I took that feedback into account when coming to a conclusion and making recommendations at the end of my capstone project.<br />
                                    <br />I was excited to take on this capstone proejct because it combines my immense love and passion for baseball with my career as a technical writer. I gained a lot of experience about the baseball world and how other people think about sabermetrics, the future of baseball, and the future of broadcasting. I incorporated all of these things in my capstone project, as well as a plan for the future. This capstone project is something I will be working on going forward, as it is a project very close to my personal and professional goals.<br />
