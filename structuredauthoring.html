									<h2>Structured Authoring Project</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/fangraphs.png" alt="Structured Authoring Dita" /></a>
								<p>My Structured Authoring project was done using OxygenXML. I chose to do a tutorial on how to use the compare tool on <a href="https://fangraphs.com">Fangraphs</a>. Fangraphs is a valuable website used for gaining information on player performance, as well as general baseball statistical knowledge. Furthermore, this site has a wealth of information that can be used to compare players to each other. I chose this project because it gives instructions for something that both is not clear and is not documented on their website.<br />
                                    <br />I gained experience in directly applying my technical writing knowledge from my coursework from the past few years, and also gained valuable experience using an XML editor. I can use this experience I've gained from my Structured Authoring project and apply it to my future career in technical writing. OxygenXML was a bit hard to learn at first, but they have a large database of documentation and examples, so I was never more than a few minutes away from a solution to one of my problems. I am glad that I gained experience in DITA and DITA XML, as it is a skill I've seen many employers advertise for. <br />
