								<p>Upon revisiting my digital literacy narrative, I found that I have made a lot more progress than I initially thought this semester. I have learned a variety of technologies, programs, and tools that I will continue to use both personally and professionally. I never thought I would be able to learn Markdown, HTML, and DITA in a short amount of time, much less a single semester. I also gained proficiency in MkDocs, Git, and publishing content to Github. <br />
									My relationship to writing with digital technology is different as a result of taking this course. I first thought that it would be a lot more difficult than it was, but it turned out to be easy, with a lot of reading and troubleshooting. The actual syntax and coding parts of Markdown and HTML aren’t hard to understand, it just took a little bit of time to get accustomed to their tags. I have also realized the importance and effectiveness of using digital technologies to publish writing and share it easily with others. <br /> 
									I have developed multiple strategies for engaging productively with new tools. My first strategy was to go into the new environment blind, experimenting with the syntax and seeing what worked and what didn’t. My second strategy was to scour the documentation for things like MkDocs and OxygenXML, as well as using Mozilla’s Developer Network for any HTML troubles I had. My last strategy was to tell myself it’s okay to make mistakes. When I was deep into making my HTML site for the course portfolio, there were multiple times I had broken something temporarily in the HTML code, and each time carefully going through the code line by line led me to find my error. My biggest piece of advice would be to stay calm and look through it slowly and completely. <br />
									I have developed writing skills in areas I had no idea I would be working in, such as the art world and the personal and professional biography departments. I also gained a lot of experience with structured authoring systems like DITA XML. This is something that I’ve wanted to do for a while because it is a coveted skill for employers, but I never knew where to start. The entire course went well; I can’t think of a single project or week that was rough. I really enjoyed my time in this class. The only thing that could have been better was the Serpentina Arts project, but the only hiccups with that project were unforeseen circumstances that could not be avoided and were not anyone’s fault. Going forward, I will continue to improve upon my HTML skills, publish more content to Github, and polish my structured authoring knowledge for a future job opportunity.
